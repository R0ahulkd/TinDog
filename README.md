🐶 TinDog - Landing Page Clone

A practice project to sharpen frontend development skills using HTML, CSS & Bootstrap.

📌 Project Overview

TinDog is a responsive landing page project built with HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 5 as a practice exercise. This project mimics the layout and design of a startup-style website for a fictional dog dating app — "TinDog" — inspired by popular landing page structures.

💡 This is not a real product. The project was developed purely for learning purposes to strengthen my understanding of responsive design, Bootstrap utilities, flexbox/grid systems, and HTML/CSS layout composition.

💡 Learning Goals
This project was created to:

Practice building multi-section responsive websites

Master Bootstrap grid and utility classes

Implement cards, buttons, icons, and layout utilities

Work with SVG icons and media elements

Learn how to structure large HTML pages using semantic tags

✅ HTML5 – for semantic structure and content
